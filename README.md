# cratera
A modified Luau environment inside of Luau.

# What is cratera?
Cratera is a implementation of Luau in Luau.
A project I started after getting increasingly frustrated with the debugging workflow built by Roblox, after stumbling upon this marvelous project by @allan_blomquist [https://youtu.be/72y2EC5fkcE] I decided to create something similar;
It does not use the same formula as the original luau however it aims to allow the same syntax available.
It is built for the Roblox platform but support might exist for the luau binaries.
